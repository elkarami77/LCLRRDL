Toolbox of lrr can be downloaded from https://sites.google.com/site/guangcanliu/lrr.zip?attredirects=0&d=1 <br>
demo_YaleB.m provides a demo for face recognition in Extended Yale B database <br>
(Sample rate is 1/2 and the number of training samples for each subject is 32) <br>
<br> 
WLRR.m is a function implementing our proposed Locality Constrained Low Rank <br>
Representation and Dictionary Learning (LCLRRDL). <br>
<br>
L2_distance.m is a function constructing the weight matrix. <br>
